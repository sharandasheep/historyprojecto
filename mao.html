		<h2>Mao Zedong</h2>
		<hr></hr>
		<h3>Biography</h3>
		<p>Mao Zedong was born in Shaoshan, China, on a farm in 1893. He hated farming and wanted to move to a city. At age 17, he supported the Kuomintang, or the KMT. Then, the Republic of China, crumbled, so he joined the Chinese Communist Party, or CCP, who worked with the KMT. Then, the KMT betrayed CCP, and he led peasant uprisings against the KMT. Finally, he built an army of peasants and established a base in Jiangxi, but he had to flee. So, he did the Long March withh his army and made an new base in Shaanxi. He got promoted to Chairman of Central Communist Committee, but then the Japanese invaded, so they had to work with the KMT again to push them out. Then, the KMT turned on them again and this time the CCP won. They changed their name to the PLA (People's Liberation Army) and established the People's Republic of China as the new government. Mao then tried to industrialze China by building communes, but it was a complete disaster, and China's economy went down. Mao then brainwashed all the youths in China with a red book containing some of his quotes, speeches, and thoughts, and made them an army that silenced everyone who was against Mao. Mao died at age 81 from a heart attack after he delivered the famous 'Hundred Flowers Speech', and he was replaced by Deng Xiaoping.</p>
		<h3>How They Would View the World Today and Why</h3>
		<p>Mao Zedong would not view the world (specifically China) that positively today because of how communist it is and its bonding with western countries, but he would see some good things like the industrialization. Mao Zedong would not appreciate the lack of communism in Chinese society and economy. There are 83 billionaires in the Chinese parliament, while the average Chinese civilian lives off of fifteen dollars a day. Mao Zedong would not see this as even a slight bit of communism and demand reformations to make it communism once again. He would also not approve of its relations with western countries, which he did not want as much of involvement with. The western countries were consuming a lot of their resources and products because of these relations. The West was too capitalist in general. The one thing that he would approve of was industrial success in Chinese economy. They were a powerhouse of mass production and it was basically the Great Leap Forward, but a success. Mao Zedong would be pleased that they had achieved this goal wonderfully. Overall, Mao Zedong would view somethings negatively and something positively.</p>
